# Physics Intuition Analysis

I've long felt that my physic intuition is whacky and wildly inaccurate (read: the Dunning-Kruger effect is real), but I wanted to test whether this hypothesis was backed up by the data or just a feeling. Read the summary on the notebook for a more in-depth conclusion but the answer, generally, is: yes, my physics intuition is whacky (some might even argue inverted).
